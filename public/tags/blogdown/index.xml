      <description>Recently, I presented my first talk at an R Ladies meetup, in beautiful Cape Town. I was lucky enough to be invited to particpate in this with two amazing R Ladies, MaÃ«lle Salmon and Stephanie Kovalchik. I had a great time and really enjoyed giving my very first R stats talk.
I considered not actually turning my talk into a blog post, as there are already some amazing resources out there by many people (some fantastic ones are curated by Mara Averick).</description>
